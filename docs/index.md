## Overview

This is an introduction to computer vision. Topics include: camera models, multi-view geometry, reconstruction, some low-level image processing, and high-level vision problems like object and scene recognition.

This course will be taught assuming:
- computer science knowledge at the level of EECS 281 (data structures) and corresponding programming ability;
- the ability to program in Python, or if not, the ability to learn to program in a new language quickly.

It will also be helpful for you to have background in the following topics. We will provide some refreshers of the necessary concepts as they arise, but we may not go through a comprehensive treatment of these topics:

- **Array Manipulation**: Homework assignments will involve manipulating multidimensional arrays using numpy and PyTorch. Some prior exposure to either of these frameworks will help; however, if you haven't done any of this sort of work before, the first homework assignment will help get you up to speed.
- **Linear algebra**: In addition to basic matrix and vector operations, it will be good to know least squares. We'll teach you about eigenvectors and the SVD as they come up.
- **Calculus**: You should be comfortable with the chain rule. It would be nice for you to have seen gradients and partial derivatives, but experience suggests you can catch on if you haven't seen these before.

If you are rusty on linear algebra and calculus (who isn't), do not worry but do make an effort to refresh your memory of both at the start of the course.
